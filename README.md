# WAPS - Whatsapp Posts Analyzer

I have dozens of WhatsApp groups myself and am interested in the analysis and insight too. 
So I built a simple WhatsApp post analyzer (waps).
It's designed for quick and private analysis. It is also a fun way for me to explore the world of AI/LLM tools. ðŸ¤–

Billions of WhatsApp groups exist. 
98% of community managers need ways to improve engagement. ðŸš€

Do you use or run WhatsApp groups? 
Would you like to understand usage and improve engagement? 

Give this simple web app a quick try.
See [WAPS v1](https://play.hemocoel.com/waps) for deployed version of this code.


I showed this tool AI Tinkerers meetup in Seattle on Feb 21, 2025.

v2 is in the works; please send me your inquiries.
